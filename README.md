Console applications are the simplest way of making functionality available to users.
But the .net console interface has a lot of shortcomings and compensating for those comes 
with a lot of code.

Console extensions are a set of extensions that help creating a better experience 
writing console applications.

## Proxy

The [ConsoleExtensions.Proxy](Proxy/README.md) wraps the console object in a interface for better testing and fluent api.

## Templating

The [ConsoleExtensions.Templating](Templating/README.md) contains a templating language for writing objects to the console.

## Reader

The [ConsoleExtensions.Reader](Reader/README.md) Simplifies getting strongly typed input from the user.

## Commandline

The [ConsoleExtensions.Commandline](Commandline/README.md) wraps a object and translates the command line arguments to method calls.
